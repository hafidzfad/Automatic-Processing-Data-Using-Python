## Inspiration and Need
This is my project when doing practical work in a company. So at the end of each month the company requires transaction history data that must be processed in such a way. They still use Microsoft Excel formulas which can be said to be quite complicated and old. So I made this Simple Python Script which can process data automatically simultaneously and efficiently.
